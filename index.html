	<h1>Jake Dustin</h1>
		<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I was born in Provo and raised in a large family. I've always enjoyed
				building things and working with my hands, so computer science was a
				natural fit from the start.</p>
			<p>I am currently in my fourth year studying CS at BYU, with plans to 
				graduate in the Spring of 2022. My emphasis is in software 
				engineering, and I am especially interested in building high quality
				, easy to understand user interfaces. I love graphic design and 
				helping users to have the best possible experience.</p>
